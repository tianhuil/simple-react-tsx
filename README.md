# webpack

## Origins
- [This article](https://www.robinwieruch.de/minimal-react-webpack-babel-setup/#webpack-react-setup) forms the basis and provides support for webpack, babel, react, and hot module replacement.
- Used [this README](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Babel-Starter) to configure babel typescript.
- The [following SO article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36510627/cant-import-typescript-modules-without-providing-the-file-extension) explains how to import from tsx by setting the correct order of the resolve field in `webpack.config.js`.
