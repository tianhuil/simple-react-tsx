# webpack

## Origins
- [This article](https://www.robinwieruch.de/minimal-react-webpack-babel-setup/#webpack-react-setup) forms the basis and provides support for webpack, babel, react, hot module replacement, and the general setup under `src/` and `dist/`.
- Used [this README](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Babel-Starter) to configure babel typescript.
- The [following SO article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36510627/cant-import-typescript-modules-without-providing-the-file-extension) explains how to import from tsx by setting the correct order of the resolve field in `webpack.config.js`.
- [This article](https://medium.com/a-beginners-guide-for-webpack-2/using-sass-9f52e447c5ae) and [the sass-loader README](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader) define how to load `scss` files.

## The important files
- `package.json`
- `webpack.config.js`
- `src/`
- `dist/`

## Optional files
- `.editorconfig`
- `tsconfig.json`
